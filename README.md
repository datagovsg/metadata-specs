# Data.gov.s[]()g Metadata Specifications

## Purpose of document 

The **Data.gov.s[]()g** Data Package is based on the protocol proposed by [Open Knowledge International]().

The adoption of the "tidy", machine readable format for data files on **Data.gov.s[]()g** requires metadata to be excluded in the data files. The Open Knowledge International protocol provides a neat solution to packaging metadata with tidy, reusable datasets. 

This document explains the structure of metadata for datasets on **Data.gov.s[]()g** and what each element means. 

Each resource download contains the following in a zip file:

1. Data file(s) in CSV, SHP or KML format
2. Metadata text file in [YAML](http://yaml.org) (See [sample](./sample.txt))

The plain text version of the metadata is based on YAML, a format that is both human- and machine-readable. 

>*See our [Data Quality Guide](https://github.com/datagovsg/data-quality) for details on the requirements for tabular data.*

## Notes

### Metadata Structure
There are 3 levels of metadata required for the new data.gov.sg:

1. Dataset metadata
    - This is the general metadata for a dataset, which includes information such as category, publishing agency, and frequency of updates.
2. Resource metadata
    - A dataset may have multiple resources. Each resource has a unique title, last updated date, and footnotes that are specific to it.
3. Schema
    - This defines the characteristics of each column in a resource file, such as variable type, format and footnotes (where applicable).

### Quick Note on Capitalisation
For easy reading, all words in titles and unit of measure should be capitalised, with the following exceptions: 

1. Short Forms: All letters should be capitalised.
2. Conjunections: These are words such as *and*, *that* and *since*. Always in lower case.
3. Prepositions: These are words such as *by*, *at* and *for*. Always in lower case.

Example:
*Population by Age and Ethnic Group*


### Required Fields

The Input and Required? columns in Sections 1, 2 and 3 indicate what is required of agency administrators. 

#### Input
This states whether a field will be filled in automatically or requires user input:

| Value | Description                                                                  |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Mixed | Partially generated by system. Users are allowed to add in additional input. |

#### Requirement
States whether a metadata field must be filled in. Represented as **Req** in short.

## 3. Metadata for Schema
The schema is a part of the metadata for each CSV resource, which provides details on each column in the table.

| Field | Description | Input | Required |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| `Name` | This must correspond to the unique column header in the data file. It is case-sensitive. | Auto | O |
| `Title` | The human-readable title of the column. | User | O |
| `Type` | Data type. See next section **Data Types** for the full listing. <br><br>Note: Some variables represented as numbers, such as telephone numbers and postal codes, are classified as strings, not numeric variables, as they are not quantitative in nature. | User | O |
| `Sub Type` | Data sub-type. This is dependent on the type field. See next section [Data Types](#4_data_types) for the full listing of data sub-types used. | User | O |
| `Description` | Each variable may have multiple lines of description.

| `Unit of Measure` | Compulsory for `numeric (general)` variables. <br><br>If the  column contain counts, the common form is "No. of [object]s", such as `No. of Students`. <br><br>For monetary values, we use `S$` as the unit of measurement. If the amount is in thousands, millions or billions, we use `S$ Thousand/Million/Billion`. For indices, we use `Index` as the unit of measurement. <br><br>For other numeric variables that are not counts, we use an appropriate generic measure such as `Ratio`. | User | △ |
| `Format` | Compulsory for all `datetime` types. This is automatically generated for `date`, `date_time` and `time` sub types. For example, the format for a *month* column will be *yyyy-mm*. | Auto | △ |
| `Coordinate System` | Compulsory for `location` types. | Auto | △ |

## 4. Data Types
Data administrators will need to specify the types and sub-types for each data field in the Schema. Only types discovered by the validation tool can be selected. 

If the chosen type/sub-type is not applicable to the entire column, an error message will be shown. 

| Type | Sub-Type | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `string` | `general` | No specific format or feature. This applies to variables such as names, categories and sub-categories. |
| | `address` | No specific format requirements, but required for visualisation tools. |
| | `postal_code` | All postal codes must be 6-digit numbers. |
| | `email` | Email addresses must be in the form local@domain. e.g. john@email.com |
| | `telephone_numbers` | Telephone numbers will normally be detected as numeric unless non-numeric characters are included. Please take note to change the data type to this instead. |
| `numeric`| `general` | Non-percentages are all of this sub-type. <br><br>Note that the `Unit of Measure` field in the schema is compulsory for this sub-type. |
| | `percentage` | Percentages are stored as a fraction of 1 or 100. For example, 1% can be stored as 0.01 either 1. This must be specified by the user. <br><br>The following will be automatically be appended to the description field of the Schema if this sub-type is chosen: <br><br>"Percentages are expressed as number out of 1; i.e. 0.01 means 1%." <br>*or* <br>"Percentages are expressed as a number out of 100; i.e. 0.01 means 0.01%." |
